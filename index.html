<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<h3>1.1 What is the Web, and what are Web pages and Web sites?</h3>

<p>The term World Wide Web
(WWW<sup><a id="fref_1" href="#fnote_1">[1]</a></sup>), or just Web, for short,
seems to have two distinguishable but closely related meanings:

<ol>
  <li>An Internet service<sup><a id="fref_2" href="#fnote_2">[2]</a></sup>
  providing means to serve and retrieve information in the form of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> documents,
  so-called Web pages.<sup><a id="fref_3" href="#fnote_3">[3]</a></sup>
  </li>
  <li>The entirety of publicly accessible Web sites and the content they
  provide.
  </li>
</ol>

<p><i>World Wide Web</i>, <i>WWW</i>, or <i>Web</i>, without an article,
usually refer to the service (or method), while <i>the Web</i> etc. refer to
the second meaning given in the above definiton.</p> 
<!-- to the documents/the content provided in those hypertext documents -->

<p>A Web site, then, is an [entitiy] serving Web pages. Though the term may
simply refer to just about any collection of related Web pages just as
well.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, the defining quality of the Web is being a world-wide,
distributed hypertext system, publicly accessible from anywhere where there's
an Internet connection. That's the idea, at least.</p>

<!-- Surfing an browsing -->
<!-- [[“surfable”] Web sites]
[browsable] Web pages -->
</p>

<h3>1.2 What is reasonable Web design?</h3>

<p>First and foremost, reasonable Web design is the subject of an ongoing
debate. The notion of what makes Web design reasonable [governing/that has
inspired/... in] this guide may be described as orthodox, minimalist, and, in
a way, conservative.</p>

<p>It is orthodox in that it tries to stay true to the limitations inherent in
the medium's design, except where that would defy reason (e.g., CSS will be
used). <!--(This is not necessarily because these limitations are perceived as
generaly good but because, given that the Web is already kind of a broken
wheel, not respecting them would lead to a cascade of broken wheels.)-->
It is minimalist in the same sense that it is orthodox, but
also in the sense that it emphasizes finding the most elegant solution to a
problem. Minimalism, understood this way, does not try to get away with first
using a YAGNI chainsaw on the problem and then providing a simple solution to
half of it that is hard to use. Instead, it strives for a reliable and
convenient solution to the whole problem, albeit with a strong focus on
confining complexity to the necessary minimum. Finally, it is conservative
in the sense that it rejects HTML5 as well as the idea of Web sites as
applications running in the user's browser.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that doesn't play very well with the current-day average “web
developer's” or even the W3C's current notion of what reasonable Web design is
supposed to look like. That said, the author considers the following guidelines
to be a collection of principles to seriously increase the Web's general
usability, not a set of tips on how to make Web pages appear cool and
clever.</p>
<!-- What's wrong with looking cool, though? What is this really tryign to
say? -->

<p>Some will argue that<!--, given the limitation/that medium design,--> Web
design can hardly be reasonable in the first place, and, honestly, that's a
fair point. Still, Web design can be way more reasonable than today's standard
mess. If the Web is broken by design, this is a guide on how not to make the
worst of it.</p>

<p>The core principle of reasonable Web design as presented here is a radical
focus on content – primarily text – and no-nonsense presentation.</p>  

<p>This doesn't mean, however, that such Web design leaves no room for
individual design choices and confines human expression solely to a Web site's
content. On the contrary, the constraints [coming with] the approach laid out
in this document will likely inspire well-thought-out, original design to a far
greater extent than a vast array of questionable “frameworks” and ready-made 
designs to choose from.</p>

<p>[What reasonable Web design means in particular is in the Guidelines
below.]</p> 

<h4>Unsorted</h4>

<p>A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to look
at and read, or, occasionally, to interact (through forms). A reasonably
designed website is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization
of the website visitor.</p>

<p>A reasonable web design is honest about what a website is and what it
<em>isn't</em>. A website is not a magazine, though it might have magazine-like
articles. A website is not an application, although you might use it to
purchase products or interact with other people. A website is not a database,
although it might be driven by one.</p>

<p>A website is about giving visitors content to enjoy and ways to interact
with you.</p>

<p>The design guidelines outlined above—and detailed below—all are in the
service of making websites more of what they are and less of what they aren't.
These aren't restrictive rules to produce dull and boring websites. Rather these
are a set of priorities that put the visitor to your site—the entire reason your
website exists—front and center in all things.</p>


<h2>2. Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Content is strictly static</h3>

<!-- Meaning static once it's served, of course. -->

<p>Web pages ought to be static documents (the only exception being forms).
Text is static, images are static. Audio and video playback are not static.</p>

<p>In short: web pages follow the model of printed texts as much as reasonably
possible. The reason for that is simple: Not doing that will create an appaling
mess, as can be seen by the state of today's Web.</p>
<!-- except that web pages don't follow the model of printed text all too much
because they're hypertext, which has some implications… -->

<h4>Hypertext, not hypermedia</h4>

<p>The above implies that Web pages = hypertext, not hypermedia. Not using the
term hypermedia. Reasons: 1. Hyperlinks to any sort of resource should be text.
Using images as ‘link text’ is bad practice and alt text doesn't cure it. 2.
The notion of reasonable Web design governing this document is that Web pages
should consist primarily of text, and images only in addition to that (except,
e.g., for image galleries).</p>

<p>Embedding of video and audio files into Web pages is considered an
anti-pattern. Why would a Web browser need to have its application scope blown
up in order to play back audio and video files when perfectly usable and tried
tools for these purposes exist outside of the browser already? Playing those
files with external tools, chosen by the user, is how it's supposed to be – and
actually was, for quite a while.</p>

<!-- Yeah, but why? Because it doesn't fit with what Web pages were designed
for, which isn't to say that the things used to build the Web pages are
particularly well-designed, more kind of like the oppsite. -->


<h3 id="readable-content">Content is readable on all reasonable screens and
devices.</h3>

<p>Most websites exist to deliver content for you to consume, either words (such
as on this site), or images, such as on
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Featured_pictures">the
Featured Pictures page on Wikimedia Commons</a>. To be true to that nature,
the content must be readable in all browsers. Some screens are very large, while
others are very small. Some browsers, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen readers</a>, have
no screen at all.</p>

<p>By default, a website that uses
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#elements">HTML as intended</a>
and has no custom styling will be readable on all screens and devices. Only the
act of design can make the content less readable, though it can certainly make
it more. For example, this website does not use default styles, yet, it is
readable on any size screen.</p>


<h3>Interactive elementes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>TODO: Name them.</li>
  <li>TODO: Explain what to use when.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Only hyperlinks and buttons respond to [clicks].</b></p>
<!-- …and so do input fields in forms -->

<p>A website is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> document that 
allows for two primary forms of interaction: navigating a link to another 
location, and submitting information back to a server. These functions are
performed, respectively, by hyperlinks and buttons.</p>

<p>Although JavaScript allows any element to respond to a click, websites are
not applications, and the vast majority of websites should have no need to
resort to such heroics in order to allow the visitor to navigate or submit data.
Further, clickable areas of a page that are not obviously hyperlinks or buttons
can confuse the visitor, causing them to perform unwanted actions or miss links
entirely.</p>

<h4>1. Formatting hyperlinks</h4>

<h5>1.1 Sane URLs</h5>

<p>When not directly linking to a file, put a trailing slash.</p> 

<h5>1.2 Expressive link text</h5>

<p>The second thing to consider when creating hyperlinks is the link text
(traditionally called anchor text), i.e., the text that will be displayed as
[the label] [leading to/for] the given URL. For example, we could link to
<a href="#">the top of this page</a> or <a href="">[Don Norman's/Jakob
Nielsen's] article on formatting hyperlinks</a>.</p>

<p>Link text should be expressive, meaning it should provide a concise and clear
indication of where following the given link will lead and for what purpose.</p>

<p>A good method for coming up with reasonable link texts is to write them in
such a way that if someone was merely scanning the page, those link texts would
give that person a good idea of what the links are about, without having to read
much, or any, of the surrounding text.</p>

<p>For example, linking to the
<a href="https://github.com/msiism/reasonable-web-design">source repository for
this very guide on GitHub</a> will hardly leave anyone guessing, even if they've
only read the heading of this page and that link text. Merely saying that the
source for this very guide is
<a href="https://github.com/msiism/reasonable-web-design">available on
GitHub</a> will, instead leave people clueless about what you're refering to as
being available on GitHub unless they read the whole sentence. A considerably
worse variant, equivalent forms of which can be found all around the Web, is
putting it this way: For the source of this very guide on GitHub, click
<a href="https://github.com/msiism/reasonable-web-design">here</a>. “Here” is
completely dependent on context, which is bad for link text. Also, who are you
to tell people which method to use to follow links? They could be using a
keyboard or voice input instead of a mouse. Ergo: “Click here” and similar
nonsense has no place in well-formed hyperlinks.</p> 

<p>Getting link text right can be quite a bit of a challenge and is likely to
involve [refactoring] the sentence or even paragraph a link occurs in. That
said, it's not always possible to get link text perfectly right. Thus, requiring
[the reader/a visitor] to read a bit of surrounding text sometimes can't be
avoided.

<p>As a rule of thumb: Expressivness is more important than brevity. But there's
a limit to that rule, of course. If you're using whole sentences as link text,
you're almost certainly doing it wrong. The longer the link text, the harder
it is to get an idea of the what and why for a particular link [quickly],
especially for people who are merely scanning the text. I.e., expressiveness
depends on brevity to a certain extent. Also, long link text is in itself
annoying to read That, on the other hand doesn't mean putting more than three,
or five etc. words as link text is automatically bad. The example of
well-thought-out link text in this section contains eight words and that's
fine.</p>

<p>There is usually no reason to use the URL itself also as the link text. All
sane browsers offer their users a convenient way to look at the URL of a link
they focus or hover over with the mouse. However, using the URL also as the
link text does make sense where the URL a hyperlink points to is concerned
explicitly.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lists of download mirrors for [Linux distributions] because…</li>
  <li>Pointing out that someone used the wrong URL in a link and providing the
    correct URL as a hyperlink for convenience. Double-check that URL and link
    text really match, in such a case.</li>
</ul>

<h5>1.3 A visual appearance aiding readability and orientation</h5>

<p>Hyperlinks should, in general, be underlined at all times. Permissible
exceptions include links that are clearly part of a menu bar and links on Web
pages that naturally have a lot of them in their content (e.g., Wikipedia).
(And this might well be it in terms of permissible exceptions.)</p>

<p>A hyperlink has no equivalent outside of hypertext. And since the dawn of
the Web, convention dictates a hyperlink use an underline to reveal its
existence. This is a neat solution because the use of underlining in
non-hypertext has been obsoleted in modern typesetting.<!-- Prove it! --></p>

<!--use underlining to denote links--> 

<p>So, it is underlining that is free to mark [something] that is beyond
[printed] text. And on Web pages, that's hyperlinks.</p>

<p>Because of this … convention, there is no clearer indicator of [more
content] than a bit of underlined text.</p>

<p>All other standard formatting options are “taken”, which is also why they
should not be used as a basis to format links. Do not format hyperlinks bold
or italic unless they are special and not running any risk of being confused
with bold or italic text in general.</p>

<p>Using only color to denote links is a considerably bad idea. Anyone who does
that should try to work with a greyscale version of what they designed, for a
week. Then they would notice that while shades of grey might be relatively easy
to tell from one another in a small piece of text when they're sufficiently
different, it's a pain to locate bits of a certain shade of grey in a larger
body of text. Underlining mitigates this to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>One reason not underlining menu links is allowed is that they are not part
of larger bodies of regular text, but pretty much on their own.</p>

<p>Also: No multi-linking without regular text inbetween! That's deceptive.
People may well mistake it for a single link and miss out on the others (and
never realize that).</p>

<h4>Forms</h4>

<h5>Buttons…</h5>

<p>…look like buttons.</p>

<p>Buttons, however, do have an analog in both the real world and computer
programs. The browser being a computer program, it stands to reason that buttons
rendered in a browser should look like buttons rendered on the computer
operating system running said browser. With no effort at all, this is precisely
what happens. See for yourself:</p>

<form id="form1" action="#form1" method="post">
	<p>
	<label for="e-mail-address1">E-Mail address: </label>
		<input type="text" id="e-mail-address1"><br>
	<input type="submit" value="Submit">
	</p>
</form>

<p>This button is unambiguous, both in its function and its difference from a
hyperlink. Where a link promises more information for the visitor, a button
agrees to submit <em>the visitor's information</em> to the server. Hiding this
interaction behind a hyperlink or unadorned text betrays the core nature of a
website.</p>

<p>That said, the default visual appearance of a button is often unpleasant or
clashes with the visual language of the site. Fortunately, many forms indicate
button-ness to a visitor, and it's often trivial to style a button to both match
the visual language of a site while also looking eminently pressable. Here is
an example of a site using a yellow color scheme and serifed fonts that
has an obvious button:</p>

<form id="form2" action="#form2" method="post">
	<p>
	<label for="e-mail-address2">E-Mail address: </label>
		<input type="text" id="e-mail-address2"><br>
	<input type="submit" value="Submit">
	</p>
</form>

<!-- Use the following as a caption for the above form:
    <p><br>Note: this is not a real form</p>
-->

<p>Notice also that the form elements are true to themselves. An operating
system has a visual language for collecting input from a visitor, and a
reasonable web design stays as close to that as possible.</p>

<h3 id="back-button">The back button works as expected.</h3>

<p>All browsers have a built-in button called the <em>back button</em>. This
button is a form of “undo”, taking the user back to where they were before their
last navigational click.</p>

<p>To break this core and enduring feature of the web requires a confluence of
design and programming (such feats would be better applied to smoothing the
experience of going back after a form submission). It also requires either
ignorance of (or contempt for) the site visitor, as the back button is often
their only means of undoing an errant click.</p>

<h3 id="scrolling">View content by scrolling.</h3>

<p>A website is neither a book nor a magazine. Because it's viewed in a browser,
users can scroll the browser's viewport to read content that can't fit on one
screen. This mechanism works beautifully and allows visitors to read content
without the interruptions caused by clicking and page-reloading (also note that
all browsers are able to scroll properly and don't need any assistance from
JavaScript).</p>

<p>While long-form content may require navigation and multiple pages, there's
rarely need to artificially paginate articles, blog posts, or other
medium-length content simply to satisfy advertisers or inflate engagement
numbers.</p>

<p>Scrolling also allows the visitor to consume content at their pace using a
method they prefer. Like the back button, this can only be broken by intentional
design and careless implementation. Advertisers need not suffer from scrollable
content, however.</p>

<p>That was an ad for one of my books. It was clearly marked, and easy to scroll
past while you continue to read this site. It might not be the most creative way
to place an advertisement amongst the text, but it demonstrates clearly that the
visitor's core need to easily consume a site's content need not be at odds for
that site to sell advertising.</p>

<h3 id="decoration">Decoration when needed and no unrelated content.</h3>

<p>A website is neither an application nor a video game. It is for content, and
so its design must serve that purpose. Being true to these materials need not
imply a boring website or require that all sites look the same.</p>

<p>Decoration for its own sake, often to satisfy the vanity of the designer,
goes counter to reasonable web design. Such needless decoration distracts the
visitor from the reason for visiting and makes the content secondary.</p>

<p>The same can be said of unrelated content, such as misleading links,
sensationalist headlines, or distracting images. These all attempt to take the
visitor away from the content either for advertising or to create a false
increase in engagement. Effort should be spent on compelling content, not
trickery. Content drives engagement.</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance is a feature.</h3>

<p>Websites aren't physical like a book or magazine. Their contents must be
downloaded over a computer network and then rendered in a web browser. This
takes time, but visitors are accustomed to this (up to a point).</p>

<p>Consider that the entirety of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by Jane Austen is
708 kilobytes. To download this much data using a very slow mobile connection
would be around one second (try it for yourself by
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt">reading it on Project
Gutenberg</a>). <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is over 200 pages long, and would
take
<a href="https://www.howlongtoreadthis.com/book_details.php?asin=1503290565">
over three hours</a> to read. Certainly a news article, tweet, or product
catalog can be downloaded and rendered in a comparable amount of time to a
<em>novel</em>.</p>

<p>The good news is that by adhering to the other guidelines, your website will
download and render quickly. By embracing its nature and materials, a website
adhering to reasonable web design is fast. It allows the system of network,
browser, content, and operating system to work together smoothly and
efficiently, as they were designed to. Even with decoration, advertising, and
imagery, a reasonably designed website will respect a visitor's time, bandwidth,
and battery.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-you-do">Embrace reasonable web design</h2>

<p>How much better would the web be if every site embraced reasonable web
design? How amazing would it be to have readable text, clearly-marked
interaction points, unobtrusive advertising, all wrapped up in a fast-loading
site you could consume using the native tools of your chosen device?</p>

<p>A good way to go about the design of [a Web page]/[Web pages]/[a Web site] is
to start with left-aligned black text on a white background (meaning: no styling
at all), and to apply styling <em>only to solve a specific problem</em>. This is
good advice. Embrace this, and you embrace reasonable web design. Focus on your
content and your visitors will enjoy your website. Focus on decoration or
tricking your visitors into clicking ads, and your content will suffer, along
with your visitors.</p>

<p>Here are some specific tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the semantic meaning of HTML elements.</li>
  <li>Learn about typography.</li>
  <li>Try designing for a small screen by default.</li>
  <li>Learn from designers about the choices they made and why they 
    made them.
  </li>
  <li>When in doubt, do what
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron">Tron</a> does: fight for the
    users.
  </li>
</ul>

Notes:

<p id="fnote_1">[1] The abbreviation WWW seems to have largely fallen out of use,
probably because it takes three times longer to pronounce than the actual term
(at least in English) and Web is more descriptive, though deceptively so,
concerning the WWW. At least it's a word and not some cryptic three-letter
acronym. <a href="#fref_1">[back]</a></p>

<p id="fnote_2">[2] Other Internet services include e-mail, Internet Relay
Chat (IRC), and Gopher, which is sort of similar to WWW but also quite
different. <a href="#fref_2">[back]</a></p>

<p id="fnote_3">[3] Crockford: “They're scrolls.” Are they really? Is being of
arbitrary length a sufficient criterion? They're also not bound like in a book.
Well okay, they're scrolls in a tree then, not pages in a book. That said, the
page metaphor might not be accurate, but its not completely off either and page
is, for better or worse, the established (and official?) term. This guide really
is a scroll, though. <a href="#fref_3">[back]</a></p>
