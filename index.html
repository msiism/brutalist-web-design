<h2>What is Brutalist Web Design?</h2>
    
<p>The term <em>brutalism</em> is often associated with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture">Brutalist 
Architecture</a>, however it can apply to other forms of construction,
such as web design. This website explains how.</p>

<p>The term <em>brutalism</em> is derived from the French <em>béton brut</em>,
meaning “raw concrete”. Although most brutalist buildings are made from
concrete, we're more interested in the term <em>raw</em>. Concrete brutalist
buildings often reflect back the forms used to make them, and their overall
design tends to adhere to the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_to_materials">truth to
materials</a>.</p>

<p>A website's materials aren't HTML tags, CSS, or JavaScript code. Rather,
they are its content and the context in which it's consumed. A website is for a
visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or
perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its
focus on <em>content</em>, and prioritization of the website visitor.</p>

<p>Brutalist Web Design is honest about what a website is and what it
<em>isn't</em>. A website is not a magazine, though it might have magazine-like
articles. A website is not an application, although you might use it to purchase
products or interact with other people. A website is not a database, although
it might be driven by one.</p>

<p>A website is about giving visitors content to enjoy and ways to 
interact with you.</p>

<p>The design guidelines outlined above—and detailed below—all are in the
service of making websites more of what they are and less of what they aren't.
These aren't restrictive rules to produce boring, minimalist websites. Rather
these are a set of priorities that put the visitor to your site—the entire
reason your website exists—front and center in all things.</p>

<a name="detailed-guidelines"></a>
<h2>Detailed Guidelines for Brutalist Web Design</h2>

<p> Below is a detailed look into each of the guidelines listed above. As with
all artistic constraints while you may find them frustrating, you should also
find them inspiring.</p>

<a name="readable-content"></a>
<h3>Content is readable on all reasonable screens and devices.</h3>

<p>Most websites exist to deliver content for you to consume, either words (such
as on this site), or images, such as on Pinterest. To be true to that nature,
the content must be readable in all browsers. Some screens are very large, while
others are very small. Some browsers, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen readers</a>, have
no screen at all.</p>

<p>By default, a website that uses
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#elements">HTML as intended</a>
and has no custom styling will be readable on all screens and devices. Only the
act of design can make the content less readable, though it can certainly make
it more. For example, this website does not use default styles, yet, it is
readable on any size screen.</p>

<a name="clickables"></a>
<h3>Only hyperlinks and buttons respond to clicks.</h3>

<p>A website is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> document that 
allows for two primary forms of interaction: navigating a link to another 
location, and submitting information back to a server. These functions are
performed, respectively, by hyperlinks and buttons.</p>

<p>Although JavaScript allows any element to respond to a click, websites are
not applications, and the vast majority of websites should have no need to
resort to such heroics in order to allow the visitor to navigate or submit data.
Further, clickable areas of a page that are not obviously hyperlinks or buttons
can confuse the visitor, causing them to perform unwanted actions or miss links
entirely.</p>

<p>To trick or deceive the visitor goes against the nature of a website, which
is to deliver information and interact honestly with a visitor.</p>

<a name="hyperlinks"></a>
<h3>Hyperlinks are underlined and buttons look like buttons.</h3>

<p>As mentioned when <a href="#clickables">discussing clicks</a>, only
hyperlinks and buttons should respond to clicks, since this maintains an honest
and transparent interaction with a visitor. To maintain a truth to materials,
it follows that the appearance of these elements should also be honest and
clear.</p>

<p>A hyperlink has no analog in the real world. Since the dawn of the web,
convention dictates a hyperlink use an underline to reveal its existence (which
is a wonderful solution, since underlining has no place in modern typesetting).
Because of this convention, there is no clearer indicator of more content than
a bit of underlined text.</p>

<p>Buttons, however, do have an analog in both the real world and computer
programs. The browser being a computer program, it stands to reason that buttons
rendered in a browser should look like buttons rendered on the computer
operating system running said browser. With no effort at all, this is precisely
what happens. See for yourself:</p>

<p>This button is unambiguous, both in its function and its difference from a
hyperlink. Where a link promises more information for the visitor, a button
agrees to submit <em>the visitor's information</em> to the server. Hiding this
interaction behind a hyperlink or unadorned text betrays the core nature of a
website.</p>

<p>That said, the default visual appearance of a button is often unpleasant or
clashes with the visual language of the site. Fortunately, many forms indicate
button-ness to a visitor, and it's often trivial to style a button to both match
the visual language of a site while also looking eminently pressable. Here is
an example of a site using a yellow color scheme and serifed fonts that
has an obvious button:</p>

<figure cass="ba b--gray pa3 ma0">
  <form class="pa3 bg-washed-yellow black br2 cf">
    <label for="also-not-real-form-email" class="b db f4 mb2 mid-gray
      baskerville">Enter your Email</label>
    <input class="db w-100" type="email" id="also-not-real-form-email"
      name="email" placeholder="e.g. pat@example.com">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" class="baskerville fr bg-animate
      mid-gray hover-bg-light-yellow ba pointer br3 pa2 mt3 bg-yellow">
  </form>
  <figcaption>
    <p><br>Note: this is not a real form</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Notice also that the form elements are true to themselves. An operating
system has a visual language for collecting input from a visitor, and a
Brutalist Web Design stays as close to that as possible.</p>

<a name="back-button"></a>
<h3>The back button works as expected.</h3>

<p>All browsers have a built-in button called the <em>back button</em>. This
button is a form of “undo”, taking the user back to where they were before their
last navigational click.</p>

<p>To break this core and enduring feature of the web requires a confluence of
design and programming (such feats would be better applied to smoothing the
experience of going back after a form submission). It also requires either
ignorance of (or contempt for) the site visitor, as the back button is often
their only means of undoing an errant click.</p>

<a name="scrolling"></a>
<h3>View content by scrolling.</h3>

<p>A website is neither a book nor a magazine. Because it's viewed in a browser,
users can scroll the browser's viewport to read content that can't fit on one
screen. This mechanism works beautifully and allows visitors to read content
without the interruptions caused by clicking and page-reloading (also note that
all browsers are able to scroll properly and don't need any assistance from
JavaScript).</p>

<p>While long-form content may require navigation and multiple pages, there's
rarely need to artificially paginate articles, blog posts, or other
medium-length content simply to satisfy advertisers or inflate engagement
numbers.</p>

<p>Scrolling also allows the visitor to consume content at their pace using a
method they prefer. Like the back button, this can only be broken by intentional
design and careless implementation. Advertisers need not suffer from scrollable
content, however.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Promotion</p>
  <p>Struggling with OO Design?</p>
  <p>SOLID only makes it worse</p>
</aside>

<p>That was an ad for one of my books. It was clearly marked, and easy to scroll
past while you continue to read this site. It might not be the most creative way
to place an advertisement amongst the text, but it demonstrates clearly that the
visitor's core need to easily consume a site's content need not be at odds for
that site to sell advertising.</p>

<a name="decoration"></a>
<h3>Decoration when needed and no unrelated content.
</h3>

<p>A website is neither an application nor a video game. It is for content, and
so its design must serve that purpose. Being true to these materials need not
imply a boring website or require that all sites look the same.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Web pages don't all need to look the same—they just need to stay true to
   what they are.</p>
</aside>

<p>For example, on large screens this section has a pull quote with a washed
blue background, a different text font, and an emoji! While this design employs
decoration, it's not distracting (though the pull quote <em>is</em> distracting
on a small screen, which is why it's not shown to those visitors).</p>

<p>Decoration for its own sake, often to satisfy the vanity of the designer,
goes counter to Brutalist Web Design. Such needless decoration distracts the
visitor from the reason for visiting and makes the content secondary.</p>

<p>The same can be said of unrelated content, such as misleading links,
sensationalist headlines, or distracting images.  These all attempt to take the
visitor away from the content either for advertising or to create a false
increase in engagement. Effort should be spent on compelling content, not
trickery. Content drives engagement.</p>

<a name="performance"></a>
<h3>Performance is a feature.</h3>

<p>Websites aren't physical like a book or magazine. Their contents must be
downloaded over a computer network and then rendered in a web browser. This
takes time, but visitors are accustomed to this (up to a point).</p>

<p>Consider that the entirety of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by Jane Austen is
708 kilobytes. To download this much data using a very slow mobile connection
would be around one second (try it for yourself by
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt">reading it on Project
Gutenberg</a>). <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is over 200 pages long, and would
take
<a href="https://www.howlongtoreadthis.com/book_details.php?asin=1503290565">
over three hours</a> to read. Certainly a news article, tweet, or product
catalog can be downloaded and rendered in a comparable amount of time to a
<em>novel</em>.</p>

<p>The good news is that by adhering to the other guidelines, your website will
download and render quickly. By embracing its nature and materials, a website
adhering to Brutalist Web Design is fast. It allows the system of network,
browser, content, and operating system to work together smoothly and
efficiently, as they were designed to. Even with decoration, advertising, and
imagery, a website embracing Brutalist Web Design will respect your visitor's
time, bandwidth, and battery.</p>

<a name="what-can-you-do"></a>
<h2>Embrace Brutalist Web Design</h2>

<p>How much better would the web be if every site embraced Brutalist Web Design?
How amazing would it be to have readable text, clearly-marked interaction
points, unobtrusive advertising, all wrapped up in a fast-loading site you could
consume using the native tools of your chosen device?</p>

<p><a href="https://mrmrs.cc">A friend</a> gave me design advice once. He said
to start with left-aligned black text on a white background, and to apply
styling <em>only to solve a specific problem</em>. This is good advice. Embrace
this, and you embrace Brutalist Web Design. Focus on your content and your
visitors will enjoy you and your website. Focus on decoration or tricking your
visitors into clicking ads, and your content will suffer, along with your
visitors.</p>

<p>Here are some specific tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the semantic meaning of HTML elements.</li>
  <li>Learn about typography.</li>
  <li>Try designing for a small screen by default.</li>
  <li>Learn from designers about the choices they made and why they 
    made them.
  </li>
  <li>When in doubt, do what
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron">Tron</a> does: fight for the
    users.
  </li>
</ul>
