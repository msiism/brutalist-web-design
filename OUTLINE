General remarks on site structure and page layout(?)

40. Formatting text:

  40.1 [Block-level things]
  
    * Use paragraphs liberally

  40.2 [Inline-level things]

    * Emphasis
      * bold and italic (<em> and <strong>)
        * elaborate on differenc ein purpose beyond “emphasis” and “strong
          emphasis”
      * Never underline text that is not a hyperlink. It's best to simply erase
        the <u> tag from your HTML vocabulary. It's been officially deprecated
        for [<time range>], aynway:

    * The abiguity of italics and bold text
      * <i>, <b> vs. <em>,<strong> in the wild

        different, which is not really a good idea).
